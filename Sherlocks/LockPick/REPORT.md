# **LockPick**

**Sherlock Scenario**

Forela needs your help! A whole portion of our UNIX servers have been hit with what we think is ransomware. We are refusing to pay the attackers and need you to find a way to recover the files provided.

**Warning**

This is a warning that this Sherlock includes software that is going to interact with your computer and files. This software has been intentionally included for educational purposes and is NOT intended to be executed or used otherwise. Always handle such files in isolated, controlled, and secure environments.

Once the Sherlock zip has been unzipped, you will find a DANGER.txt file. Please read this to proceed.

![03](./img/03.png)

Si decompila il file eseguibile:

![06](./img/06.png)

Alla funzione **process_directory** vengono passati:
- Cartella target: **/forela-criticaldata/**
- Chiave di cifratura: **bhUlIshutrea98liOp**

![07](./img/07.png)

Della cartella **/forela-criticaldata/** si cifrano solo i file con estensione: .txt, .sql, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .csv, .json e .xml . 

![08](./img/08.png)

La routine di cifratura si basa sul calcolare lo XOR del file con la chiave **bhUlIshutrea98liOp**. 

Il contenuto del file cifrato viene inserito in un nuovo file **FILENAME.24bes**.

![09](./img/09.png)

I file **FILENAME_note.txt** contengono delle indicazioni per decifrare i files.

Al termine della routine di cifratura i file vengono cancellati.

Per riottenere i file originali basta semplicemente riapplicare l'operazione XOR sulla cartella target.
